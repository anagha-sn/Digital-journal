Project Overview

My Sunny Day Journal is an interactive, mood-based digital journaling web application designed to make self-reflection engaging, creative, and visually expressive.

Unlike traditional text-only journals, this platform allows users to:
Select their mood
Express emotions visually using a drawing canvas
Experience playful animations
Save their daily reflections in a fun and comforting environment
The goal of this project is to promote emotional awareness and creativity through a simple, user-friendly web interface.

Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced digital world, many individuals struggle to maintain emotional awareness and mental well-being. Although journaling is widely recommended as a self-reflection practice, existing journaling platforms often feel:

Text-heavy and formal

Emotionally disconnected

Boring or repetitive

Overwhelming for beginners

As a result, users lose motivation and consistency in maintaining a journal.

There is a need for a simple, engaging, and interactive digital journaling platform that makes emotional expression easy, creative, and enjoyable—especially for students and young users.

💡 Proposed Solution

My Sunny Day Journal is an interactive digital journaling web application designed to make self-reflection visually expressive and emotionally engaging.
The platform solves the problem by:
1️⃣ Making Emotion Selection Easy
Users can select their mood using emoji-based buttons, allowing quick emotional expression without writing long paragraphs.
2️⃣ Enabling Creative Expression
A built-in drawing canvas allows users to visually represent their day through colors and sketches, making journaling more interactive.
3️⃣ Creating a Positive Experience
Playful animations (windmill spin, floating bubbles) create a calming and cheerful environment that encourages regular use.
4️⃣ Supporting Simplicity
The interface is minimal and beginner-friendly:
No complex setup
No distractions
Easy navigation
